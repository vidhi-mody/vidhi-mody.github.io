 Day 18 of the May LeetCoding Challenge by Leetcode
Problem definition: Permutation in String Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string&amp;rsquo;s permutations is the substring of the second string.
 Note:
 The input strings only contain lower case letters. The length of both given strings is in range [1, 10,000].</description>
