      <description>“Its the not the Destination, It&amp;rsquo;s the journey.”
~ Ralph Waldo
 It&amp;rsquo;s been less than a month but this community has really grown on me. The past few weeks have been really eventful. A huge shoutout to my mentor, Željko for giving me the best on-boarding experience ever. In this short span, I got to meet the entire QTE &amp;amp; Release Engineering team. I also gained a new sense of professionalism and a clearer view of what it meant to be working as a community!</description>
