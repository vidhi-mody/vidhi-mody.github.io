      <description>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry if it doesn‚Äôt work right. If everything did, you‚Äôd be out of a job.‚Äù
~ Mosher‚Äôs Law of Software Engineering
 I would like to start this blog with one of the stories shared on the WaterCooler by James. (Read more about &amp;lsquo;WaterCooler&amp;rsquo; in my previous blog.)
Early in his career he worked in an aviation company in UK. The project was related to the network connectivity of the airplane during it&amp;rsquo;s entire journey.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúIt&amp;rsquo;s not the Destination, It&amp;rsquo;s the journey.‚Äù
~ Ralph Waldo
 It&amp;rsquo;s been less than a month but this community has really grown on me. The past few weeks have been really eventful. A huge shoutout to my mentor, ≈Ωeljko for giving me the best on-boarding experience ever! (üì£ You can checkout his blog on GSoC here.) In this short span, I got to meet the entire QTE &amp;amp; Release Engineering team.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúThe mission of the Wikimedia Foundation is to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally.&amp;quot;
 I am pleased to share that I have been accepted into Google Summer of Code 2020 under Wikimedia Foundation!
I believe that Open source projects are a great way of developing quality products by working together with other developers.</description>
