      <description>‚ÄúIt&amp;rsquo;s not the Destination, It&amp;rsquo;s the journey.‚Äù
~ Ralph Waldo
 It&amp;rsquo;s been less than a month but this community has really grown on me. The past few weeks have been really eventful. A huge shoutout to my mentor, ≈Ωeljko for giving me the best on-boarding experience ever! (üì£ You can checkout his blog on GSoC here.) In this short span, I got to meet the entire QTE &amp;amp; Release Engineering team.</description>

 I am pleased to share that I have been accepted into Google Summer of Code 2020 under Wikimedia Foundation!
I believe that Open source projects are a great way of developing quality products by working together with other developers.</description>
