      <description>‚ÄúWith tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don‚Äôt know if our code is getting better or worse.‚Äù
~ Michael Feathers (Working Effectively with Legacy Code)
 One of the best experience in this duration was attending the TDD Workshop. The workshop was about learning basics of Test Driven Development - its rules and Red-Green-Refactor loop. The workshop was very interactive and all the participants worked together while writing code as well as refactoring it.</description>

 I would like to start this blog with one of the stories shared on the WaterCooler by James. (Read more about &amp;lsquo;WaterCooler&amp;rsquo; in my previous blog.)
Early in his career he worked in an aviation company in UK. The project was related to the network connectivity of the airplane during it&amp;rsquo;s entire journey.</description>

~ Ralph Waldo
 It&amp;rsquo;s been less than a month but this community has really grown on me. The past few weeks have been really eventful. A huge shoutout to my mentor, ≈Ωeljko for giving me the best on-boarding experience ever! (üì£ You can checkout his blog on GSoC here.) In this short span, I got to meet the entire QTE &amp;amp; Release Engineering team.</description>
